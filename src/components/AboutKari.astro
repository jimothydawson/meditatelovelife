            I understand what it feels like when life is on top of you. When the
            internal pressure is constant. When the external demands never stop.
            When your way of doing things is no longer working.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal">
            There was a time when my life looked good on the outside — active,
            full, productive… busy. I thought I was doing all the right things.
            I was ticking a lot of boxes. But inside, I was running on empty. I
            felt shattered. Life was getting the better of me.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal">
            You know the feeling… holding it all together, while quietly falling
            apart.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal">
            My body was tired. My mind never stopped. My nervous system never
            truly rested. My relationships, my children, my work, my health, my
            sleep were all suffering. Something was missing and I felt
            disconnected. I had had enough.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal">
            That's when I found Vedic Meditation. Within days of learning,
            things shifted. Over time, my practice has changed how I live,
            mother, work, view the world, and how I love and relate to myself.
        </p>
        <div class="about-highlight reveal">
            <p>
                My training as a Vedic Meditation teacher and my lived
                experience means I bring professional knowledge and personal
                insight to people who are exactly where I once was. Ready for
                change. Not to become someone new — but to come back to your
                Self — and feel on top of life again.
