        <h2>
            The world has a tendency to pull us outward, constantly asking for
            more.
        </h2>
        <div class="accent-line"></div>
        <p>
            More doing, more giving, more distractions, more choices, more
            chasing and more holding it all together. As a result the mind
            doesn't stop. The body never fully rests.
        </p>
        <p>
            When life keeps asking more of you, you don't need to do more and
            try harder. What you are seeking is the opposite — simplicity and
            ease. Time for yourself and room to soften. Space to simply be.
