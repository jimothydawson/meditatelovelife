  "intro": "Vedic meditation is one of the oldest and most effortless forms of meditation in the world — a practice that predates the written word and has been passed from teacher to student for thousands of years.",
  "paragraphs": [
    "Unlike mindfulness or breath-based practices, Vedic meditation requires no concentration, no control of the mind, and no effort to clear your thoughts. The mind is given a simple tool — a mantra — and allowed to settle naturally, like sediment falling through water.",
    "Practised for 20 minutes, twice daily, sitting comfortably with eyes closed, Vedic meditation allows the nervous system to reach a state of rest that is deeper than sleep. Over time, this releases accumulated stress and leaves you feeling clearer, calmer, and more present.",
    "PLACEHOLDER — Add any additional detail about the Vedic tradition, how it differs from other meditation styles, or what makes it particularly suited to modern life.",
    "PLACEHOLDER — Add a note about what students can expect from a first session or course with Kari."

  "pullQuote": "PLACEHOLDER — Add a meaningful quote about Vedic meditation or stillness. For example: 'Rest is the basis of activity.' — Maharishi Mahesh Yogi"
